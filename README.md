# PEFT-based Model Fine-Tuning

This project demonstrates the use of PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques to fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models for downstream tasks. PEFT significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements of model adaptation, making it an efficient approach for scenarios with resource constraints or specialized needs.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Showcase the potential of PEFT methods in reducing the cost and complexity of fine-tuning large language models.
- Provide a clear and modular implementation for integrating PEFT into existing workflows using Hugging Face Transformers.
- Enable researchers and practitioners to explore task-specific fine-tuning with minimal computational resources while maintaining high performance.

Through this project, users can:

- Load datasets and preprocess them efficiently using the `datasets` library.
- Fine-tune transformer-based models with PEFT techniques, leveraging LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) configurations.
- Evaluate model performance using well-integrated tools like `evaluate`.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Management**: Simplifies loading and preprocessing of datasets.
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Utilizes PEFT techniques to adapt large models without retraining all parameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes seamless integration with evaluation libraries for accurate performance tracking.
- **Modular Design**: The code structure is flexible and can be easily adapted for different datasets and tasks.

## Use Cases

- Fine-tuning pre-trained models for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, or custom NLP applications.
- Adapting large models to specific domains with limited training data.
- Experimenting with cutting-edge parameter-efficient techniques for model adaptation.
